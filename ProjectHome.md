# 4Info API implementations #
This project serves as a repository for API implementations for [4Info](http://www.4info.net) web services. Currently, only 4Info Gateway API implementations are provided.

## Gateway ##
The 4Info Gateway API is a web service that allows you to seamlessly integrate SMS/text messaging into your product or service. Through this service you can:

  * Send text messages to your users to alert them of activity in your product, service, or website.
  * Access our ad network and monetize your messages.

Currently, API implementations are available in the subversion repository for the following languages:
  * PHP (4 and 5) (see [PHPExamples](PHPExamples.md))
  * Java (see [JavaExamples](JavaExamples.md))

_The API implementations are not maintained or supported by 4Info and are used at your own risk._
